# Data Mining The Dark Web

This repository contains the code used for the project taking place at UEL where in which we aim to conduct a datamining experiment in the "Dark Web" using Python and R

While the data set won't be made public until de project is published, feel free to clone/fork the repo and play around with it (or point out any issues you may find!)

### Setting up the environment

You can install the python requiremnts for this project [using python PIP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Later on, a Jupyter notebook will be added where we will allow anyone to:
 * See the outcome of the analysis
 * Interact with the code (python and R)
